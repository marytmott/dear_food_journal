Hi Lukas Ruebbelke, great write up and intro to Interceptors. It was a clear way for me to learn something new. However, I would advise that you update the article to explicitly point out the problem when you don’t manually reject the promise in the responseError or requestError handlers for the interceptor (e.g. $q.reject(response)) . Basically causing failed requests (eg. 40x response codes) being handled by the successHandler.
