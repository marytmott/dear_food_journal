tests to run:

1. secure backend
	ensure logged in
	ensure correct user


// to dos: 
clean up index.js routes (from app.js)

— error handling on login shit/journal

— finish user crud on front/back ends

*** ProjectTemplate.find().sort('creator').populate('creator', 'firstName lastName fullName').exec(function(err, projectTemplates) {
    if (err) {
        return res.status(400).send({
            message: getErrorMessage(err)
        })
    }

set expiration time and renewal on web tokens

— need to test typing in routes in url w/ middleware on angular routes

take out console logs

clear blank lines at bottom of files

- web token hash server pw

— clean up super nested routing?

— add token middleware for check tokens on server side to DRY code up

— directives for ng crud forms/updates?

.remove.exec()


need to add resolves to vm.currentuser on loads — page does not load smoothly

put $rootscope.$emit (in users factory) in separate service?

* angular scope in directives: 
What we want to be able to do is separate the scope inside a directive from the scope outside, and then map the outer scope to a directive's inner scope. We can do this by creating what we call an isolate scope. To do this, we can use a directive's scope option:
	scope: {
      		customerInfo: '=info'
    	},

Note: These =attr attributes in the scope option of directives are normalized just like directive names. To bind to the attribute in <div bind-to-this="thing">, you'd specify a binding of =bindToThis.


* only providers can go into ng.config()


* note on $q in interceptors————>

Hi Lukas Ruebbelke, great write up and intro to Interceptors. It was a clear way for me to learn something new. However, I would advise that you update the article to explicitly point out the problem when you don’t manually reject the promise in the responseError or requestError handlers for the interceptor (e.g. $q.reject(response)) . Basically causing failed requests (eg. 40x response codes) being handled by the successHandler.
