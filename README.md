# [Dear Food Journal](http://dearfoodjournal.herokuapp.com/)

## Purpose

Dear Food Journal is more than just a diet journal. It is designed to be an easy-to-use, fun, and friendly website to help people achieve their weight goals.

It has all the functionality of a diet journal - users can record their meals and nutrition info for each meal and a daily summary page shows them how they are progressing towards their goals.

## What makes this food journal different...

The app is designed to be a richer and more effective resource than just a diet journal. Dear Food Journal also includes a special inspirations section which is designed to be a place where people can add and view their own personal inspirations to encourage them and help keep them focused on achieving their goals.


## Technologies

Dear Food Journal was built on a MEAN stack:

- Mongo DB
- Express
- Angular.js
- Node.js

### Additional Technologies:

- Bootstrap
- Angular Masonry
- Nutritionix API

## Nutritionix API

Dear Food Journal uses the [Nutritionix API](http://www.nutritionix.com/api) which is a rich resourve with hundreds of thousands of food and nutrition info available so users can easily find foods they ate and add it to their meal.

Though the API is a rich resource, if a food is not found from the API, they can also add their own foods (for such cases as homemade recipes, etc.).
